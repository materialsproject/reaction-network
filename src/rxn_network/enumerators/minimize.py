            precursors: Optional list of precursor formulas. The only reactions that
                will be enumerated are those featuring one or more of these compositions as reactants. The

                precursors (the default) or just one.
            targets: Optional list of target formulas. The only reactions that
                will be enumerated are those featuring one or more of these compositions as products. The
                "exclusive_targets" parameter allows one to tune whether the enumerated reactions should include ALL
                targets or just one (the default).
            exclusive_precursors: Whether enumerated reactions are required to have
                reactants that are a subset of the provided list of precursors. If True (the default), this only
                identifies reactions with reactants selected from the provided precursors.
            exclusive_targets: Whether enumerated reactions are required to have products that are a subset of the
                provided list of targets. If False, (the default), this identifies all reactions containing at least one
                composition from the provided list of targets (and any number of byproducts).
            filter_duplicates: Whether to remove duplicate reactions. Defaults to False.
            filter_by_chemsys: An optional chemical system for which to filter produced reactions by. This ensures that
                all output reactions contain at least one element within the provided system.
            chunk_size: The minimum number of reactions per chunk procssed. Needs to be sufficiently large to make
                parallelization a cost-effective strategy. Defaults to MIN_CHUNK_SIZE.
            max_num_jobs: The upper limit for the number of jobs created. Defaults to MAX_NUM_JOBS.
            remove_unbalanced: Whether to remove reactions which are unbalanced; this is
                usually advisable. Defaults to True.
            remove_changed: Whether to remove reactions which can only be balanced by removing a reactant/product or
                having it change sides. This is also advisable for ensuring that only unique reaction sets are produced.
                Defaults to True.
            max_num_constraints: The maximum number of allowable
                constraints enforced by reaction balancing. Defaults to 1 (which is usually advisable).
